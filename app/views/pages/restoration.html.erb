    <h2>Traditional & Modern Barn Conversions</h2>
    <p>Our speciality is converting timber frame barns into either living or commercial spaces.</p>

    <p>We have many years of experience and vast knowledge in barn conversions including dismantling, moving, erecting, structurally repairing, and converting barn frames into homes and commercial facilities.</p>

    <p>Our varied barn conversion experience benefits you because weâ€™re able to find the simplest and least expensive solution to complex problems. Whether you require a traditional or modern barn conversion, or simply repairs to an existing timber frame, we can deliver beyond expectation.</p>

    <p>Barn conversions are increasingly popular. Not only do they hold their value well and provide plenty of space for the occupants, but more often than not they are situated in beautiful locations that match their stunning timber interiors. Many of which can be viewed in our Oak Frame buildings and barn conversions portfolio gallery.</p>

    <h2>Historic & Listed Building Surveys</h2>
    <p>When an existing oak frame needs to be repaired, we offer a survey and drawing service to meet these needs and satisfy listed building requirements.</p>

    <p>A barn conversion is a typical example where we would initially visit the property to assess the condition of the existing timber frame on site. As a result of this inspection, a repair schedule would be created which includes a detailed drawing of the frame elevations. The repair schedule is laid out in a logical manner, making it easy to understand and ensures that both the Conservation Officer and Client can see exactly which timbers need to be repaired or replaced.</p>

    <p>At times, works to historic buildings will occasionally require a historic building report to highlight the important architectural and historic elements of the structure, including its development and previous alterations. We have experience at producing historic building reports with our specialist focus on the timber framed element of the building.</p>
