    <h2>Oak Framed Extensions</h2>
    <p>While it can be difficult to obtain planning permission for an extension to an existing building, Mark Groombridge has a very successful history of doing so. We are committed to conservation, and the decades of experience we have in assessing the historic buildings and their potential extension ensure that we are able to propose an outstanding yet appropriate addition to your home.</p>
    <p>We have applied for and received planning permission to extend many oak framed buildings and listed buildings over the years. The close working relationship we have with the Local Authorities and Conservation Officers from the early stages right through to the fruition of each project ensures a smooth process that is beneficial to all concerned.</p>
    <p>Whatever design you have in mind, our oak framed extensions are always sympathetic to the existing buildings, creating a finished product which looks truly stunning in every respect.</p>

    <h2>Oak Framed Garages</h2>
    <p>At Mark Groombridge, we pride ourselves on the level of detail that goes into every building we create, and garages are no exception.</p>
    <p>We set ourselves apart from the majority of smaller companies who provide garages by ensuring that our garages are built to the exacting standards you would come to expect from us. Large oak sections and traditional jointing methods ensure that the oak framed garage building blends seamlessly with the rest of your home.</p>
    <p>Every garage is bespoke just like our oak framed houses, we discuss the intended use of the garage with you to ensure every bay is made to the correct size. Our understanding and knowledge of traditional building and carpentry methods ensures that every one of our oak framed garage buildings is made to the highest quality, has a real and lasting presence, and is built to stand the test of time.</p>

    <h2>Oak Framed Garden Buildings</h2>
    <p>While our oak framed extensions provide an outstanding addition to any home, not all properties have the room needed to make these a reality. A garden room can provide a stunning alternative, making your home more versatile while still using only a small amount of space.</p>
    <p>An oak garden building or room can dramatically enhance a property, using exposed and vaulted roof timbers made out of green oak to give an open feel and eye-catching appearance. We can create an oak garden building to meet your exact requirements and help turn your vision into reality, or alternatively, we can design and build a frame for a building you already have planning permission for.</p>
    <p>If you would prefer a more open room which makes the best use of light and space we can manufacture a seasoned oak conservatory. This benefits from large sections of oak interspersed with glazed panels, seamlessly blending age-old designs and construction methods with a modern touch and feel.</p>
