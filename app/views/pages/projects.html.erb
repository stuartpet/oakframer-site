  <p>We are proud to share some of our recent projects to showcase the quality and craftsmanship that go into each and every oak framed structure we design and build. From complex restoration projects and listed buildings to striking new builds, we bring deep knowledge and care to every stage of the process.</p>

  <p>Each project is unique, and our gallery reflects the breadth of work we undertake – from barn conversions and residential homes to garages, garden rooms, and commercial oak-framed buildings. Our specialist team of oak frame experts is involved at every step, ensuring a beautifully finished result tailored to the property, site, and client needs.</p>
